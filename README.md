## APPARATUS REQUIRED

| S. No | Item              | Specification   | Quantity |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1     | Microprocessor kit | 8086            | 1        |
| 2     | Power Supply      | +5 V DC, +12 V DC | 1      |
| 3     | DAC Interface board | -              | 1        |

## ALGORITHM

### Measurement of Analog Voltage
1. Send the digital value to DAC.  
2. Read the corresponding analog value at its output.  

### Waveform Generation

#### Square Waveform
1. Send low value (00) to the DAC.  
2. Introduce suitable delay.  
3. Send high value to DAC.  
4. Introduce delay.  
5. Repeat the above procedure.  

#### Sawtooth Waveform
1. Load low value (00) to accumulator.  
2. Send this value to DAC.  
3. Increment the accumulator.  
4. Repeat step (ii) and (iii) until accumulator value reaches FF.  
5. Repeat the above procedure from step 1.
